# CV Skin_Cancer
## Deep Learning Project on Skin Cancer

More than 50% of lesions are confirmed through histopathology (histo), the ground truth for the rest of the cases is either follow-up examination (follow_up), expert consensus (consensus), or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy (confocal).


Create a virtual environment with 
 `conda env create -n cv_skin_cancer --file environment.yaml`

then goes to : https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and select according to your machine

and then 

`conda activate cv_skin_cancer`
